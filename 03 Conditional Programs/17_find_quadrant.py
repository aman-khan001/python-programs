# ğŸ“š Python Program to Find Quadrant of a Point in Cartesian Coordinate System


'''
    The find_quadrant function takes the x and y coordinates of a point as input
    and returns the quadrant in which the point lies.
    It uses conditional statements to determine the quadrant based on the signs of x and y.
