# ðŸ“š Python Program to Find the Largest of Three Integers

'''
    The largest_of_three function takes three integers as input
    and returns the largest integer among them.
    It uses conditional statements to compare the integers.
'''

def largest_of_three(a, b, c):
    # Check if a is the largest or equal to both b and c
    if a >= b and a >= c:
        return a
    # Check if b is the largest or equal to both a and c
    elif b >= a and b >= c:
        return b
    # If neither a nor b is the largest, then c must be the largest
    else:
        return c
    
# Example usage
print("Largest of 3, 5, and 2:", largest_of_three(3, 5, 2))  # Output: 5
print("Largest of 10, 20, and 15:", largest_of_three(10, 20, 15))  # Output: 20
