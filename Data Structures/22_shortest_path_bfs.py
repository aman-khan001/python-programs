# ðŸ“š Python Program to Shortest Path in Unweighted Graph using BFS


'''
    In an unweighted graph, the shortest path can be found using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

# Sample graph
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []

# Finding shortest path
start_node = 'A'
goal_node = 'F'
shortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, goal_node)
print(f"Shortest path from {start_node} to {goal_node}: {shortest_path}")

# ðŸ§  Explanation:
# BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
# We track paths explicitly in the queue and return as soon as we reach the goal.
