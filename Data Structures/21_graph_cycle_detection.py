# ðŸ“˜ Program: Cycle Detection in Directed Graph using DFS
# This program detects if there's a cycle in a directed graph using DFS


'''
    A cycle in a directed graph occurs when there is a path that starts and ends at the same node.

# Example 1: Graph with a cycle
graph_with_cycle = {
    'A': ['B'],
    'B': ['C'],
    'C': ['A']
}

# Example 2: Graph without a cycle
graph_without_cycle = {
    'A': ['B'],
    'B': ['C'],
    'C': []
}

print("Graph with cycle:", has_cycle(graph_with_cycle))       # Output: True
print("Graph without cycle:", has_cycle(graph_without_cycle)) # Output: False

# ðŸ§  Explanation:
# We use a recursion stack (rec_stack) to track nodes in the current DFS path.
# If a node is revisited in the same path, a cycle exists.
