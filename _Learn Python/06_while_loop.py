# 🐣 Program: Using a While Loop


''' A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.'''

# Initializing the counter variable
num = 1

# Using a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 5
while num <= 5:
    print("Number:", num)  # Prints the current value of num
    num += 1  # Increments the counter by 1
