# 🐣 Program: Using a For Loop
# This program demonstrates how to use a for loop to iterate through a range of numbers

'''A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or a range of numbers.'''

# Using a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 5
for num in range(1, 6):
    print("Number:", num)  # Prints the current number in the loop

# Explanation:
# range(1, 6) generates numbers from 1 to 5 (6 is excluded)
# The loop runs once for each number in that range
