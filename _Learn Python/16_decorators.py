# ðŸ“˜ Program: Using Decorators in Python
# This program demonstrates how to create and use a simple decorator

# Defining a decorator function
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before the function is called")
        func()  # Call the original function
        print("After the function is called")
    return wrapper

# Using the decorator with @ syntax
@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

# Calling the decorated function
say_hello()

# ðŸ§  Explanation:
# The decorator adds behavior before and after the original function.
# When say_hello() is called, it runs wrapper(), not just the print("Hello!") line.
# This allows us to add functionality (like logging, timing, etc.) without modifying the original function.
# Decorators can also take arguments, allowing for more complex behavior.
# Decorators are often used in web frameworks, logging, and access control.
