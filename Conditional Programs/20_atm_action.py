# ðŸ“š Python Program: Basic ATM simulation
# This program defines a function to perform ATM actions such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking balance.

'''
    The atm_action function takes the current balance and an action as input.
    It performs the specified action (withdraw, deposit, check_balance) and returns the updated balance
    along with a message indicating the result of the action.
'''

def atm_action(balance, action):
    """
    Perform an ATM action based on the user's input.

    Parameters:
    balance (float): The current balance in the account.
    action (str): The action to perform ('withdraw', 'deposit', 'check_balance').

    Returns:
    tuple: Updated balance and a message indicating the result of the action.
