# ğŸ“š Python Program to Check Leap Year

"""
  This program checks if a given year is a leap year.

  A year is a leap year if:
  - It is divisible by 4;
  - If it is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400.

# Output:
# 2000 is a leap year: True
# 2004 is a leap year: True
# 1900 is a leap year: False
# 2021 is a leap year: False
# 2024 is a leap year: True
